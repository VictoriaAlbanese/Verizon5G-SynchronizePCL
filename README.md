# Verizon5G-SynchronizePCL

Rapid Synchronization of Dense Point Clouds to Enable Robotic Manipulation Applications

We are proposing to develop a method to quickly register point clouds from multiple sensors (between 4 and 8) at varying perspectives to build a comprehensive 3D model of target objects. This process can only be performed quickly and efficiently if a rapid network connection and high-performance computing is available. A concept drawing of the system can be seen here: http://cs.uml.edu/~anorton/verizon/multi-scanning_concept_drawing.jpg
